One of the main things for me is an easy on and off - with a big bang appearance.  These are perfect.  I really like that this is a fair trade item as well.  They are just so satisfying and so beautiful. And the price?? They are a STEAL.  (Helpful hint:  look for the \\\"sets\\\" - even a better price!)  Honestly, I highly recommend them - try one.  You'll be back.  In fact, I'm going to give a few a gifts.  They come in brown paper wrapped boxes that are actually gift ready.  Pop into a small holiday bag, or even just wrap with a ribbon.  It does say what it is on the outside of the box, but honestly, I'm good with that!  There is a card inside that tells what it is and even an example of how they make the item.  These are coil bracelets, that are not a new look - but these are simply beautifully done in rich, sometimes bright colors and quality made.  I can't say enough positive about them.
